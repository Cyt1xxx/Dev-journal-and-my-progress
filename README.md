1) Changed parsing mode to other website, successfully working, during transition mastered a bit of datetime module as : timedelta , timezone , fromtimestamp , unix timestamp computer time to human readable.
   Added mini docs as string description for mainly each func, repeated urlib , how it works and parses / collecting url , with & separator and = sign. Refactored some existing funcs , repeated dict comprehension.
2) A lot of theory - fewere practise and code , could do a lot more
3) Good that when I had problem with some module I tried not just copying code from forum without understanding , but to read docs , test it in other situations with other behaviour. But didn`t have a balance xD
