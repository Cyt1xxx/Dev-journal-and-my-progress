# Dev-journal-and-my-progress
Keeping working to improve myself at programmin , posting my results of studying sessions particulary every day.
Previous dev.journal was in my diary , written by hand.
1 - everything what i did during a day
2 - struggles , problems , or some distractions
3 - pluses, benefit , pros, that i completed well 

01.09.2025 Programming hours: 7-7.5h
1) Finally understood advanced logging features and imlemented to my project , set up new logger config for SA , web scraper logs and main script logs + db;
   Fixed bugs with asyncio tasks runner to run 2 tasks + concurrentlty with cooldown in while True loop;
   Made custom request headers settings , refactored a bit all of code;
   Changed fetcher of pages
2) Was struggling with advanced logging features , did it for 3 hours, read docs , stack , watched youtube , finally did it. Other problems were solved in quite short period of time
3) Other problems were solved in quite short period of time.

02.09.2025 Programming hours: 6-6.5 h
1) Changed parsing mode to other website, successfully working, during transition mastered a bit of datetime module as : timedelta , timezone , fromtimestamp , unix timestamp computer time to human readable.
   Added mini docs as string description for mainly each func, repeated urlib , how it works and parses / collecting url , with & separator and = sign. Refactored some existing funcs , repeated dict comprehension.
2) A lot of theory - fewere practise and code , could do a lot more
3) Good that when I had problem with some module I tried not just copying code from forum without understanding , but to read docs , test it in other situations with other behaviour. But didn`t have a balance xD
   
03.09.2025 Day off

04.09.2025 (5.30-6h)
1) Refactored the main software code , still there are problems, was repeating OOP principles , learned abut dequeue , why it is more efficient sometimes then list for non-memorizing task , where data need to be processed immideately , i.e don`t necessary to be stored for a while
2) Again , was struggling with choosing the right proxy servise , lost money on efforts , was just thinking for 3-4 h just how to do it without trying actually to write a code
3) Finally I decided how to do it , made 50% of logic , but it was already too late

05.09.2025 (5h)
1) Unfortunaly, no code today , was existed about cyber security topics such as: XSS , WAF , how to prevent abusing your API for malicious tasks, refactored code a bit , there was a critical error with While loop in coroutine + prevent db blocking and working with each task with asyncio.Lock in software.
2) Didn`t finish Proxy manage , a bit of bored and lazy today
3) I explored a lot new info that can help me in buildings my API`s and providing them security , noticied critical errors
